- Authentication: You are who you say you are
- Authorization: You are allowed to do x, y, and z tasks

3 different types of api authentication/authorization:

1. Basic Authentication: you just send a username/password (and that's it) to access
2. Token Authentication:
   - Send username/password, get a token back
   - Token can have extra features like expiries, set limits on requests.
3. OAuth 2.0:
   - Does not authenticate, only authorizes
   -
